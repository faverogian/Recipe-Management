# Recipe-Management
Gian Favero, 2022

This is a built-from-scratch shopping list and meal program put together for time efficient meal planning. When away at school, on a job, or caring for a family, planning meals that don't get tiresome or repetitive can be a strenuous task. I created this Recipe Management tool to take the onus of picking healthy, tasty meals for each day of the week away from me so that I could spend more time working or studying and less on cramming a last-minute meal into my schedule.

### Initial Program
The premiere edition of this Recipe Management tool is customized to my preferred food categories and meals. A .json file is used to house the recipes and ingredients in a categorized format, while my weekly schedule (ie. I want pasta on Mondays, a meat on Tuesdays etc.) is hardcoded elsewhere in the code. By simply running the `Application_main.py` script, I receive a weekly menu as well as the shopping list required to satisfy the ingredients of the meals. 

### Under Development
A customizeable and scalable rendition of the Recipe Management tool fitted with a GUI is under development for a more versatile experience with a variety of users.
